Read and follow the rules in AGENTS.md (in this folder).

MODE: PLANNING ONLY (no code changes, no patches, no execution).

Goal: Propose new features for this project.

Requirements:
- Suggest 3-8 viable feature ideas.
- Rank them highest to lowest by end-user UX / value (UX/value is the primary decision factor).
- Do not prioritize "easy to build" unless it also clearly improves UX/value.
- Do not treat anything as approved - these are proposals only.

For each feature (keep it concise):
- Name (short)
- What it does (1-2 sentences)
- Who it helps / why it matters (1 sentence)
- Biggest risk or dependency (1 bullet)
- How you would validate success (1 bullet; user-facing metric or acceptance criteria)

Output format:
1) Ranked list of features
2) A short "Top pick summary" (2-4 lines) explaining why the #1-#2 options win on UX/value

Update/append/create tracking doc:
- recommended_features.md (with the bullet points created per feature)

Minimize follow-up questions. If info is missing, make reasonable assumptions and state them briefly.
