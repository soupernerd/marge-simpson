Read the AGENTS.md file in this folder and follow it.

Instructions:
- Audit the assessment and tasklist files in planning_docs/. Look for solid reasoning in the actions taken
- Audit the workspace and compare it to your assessment and tasklist audit above, make sure all actions taken were good decisions
- Find an expert for the above in the experts/ folder
- Audit CLI functions, ensure they match intended functionality. Reference docs as needed.
- When conflicts exist, pick the option that makes the most sense based on what creates a more robust system, not ease of implementation

Read-only, update assessment.md and tasklist.md (etc) as you go

Loop until clean, minimum 20 iterations.

1 loop = ENTIRE audit of the workspace

Output using the Response Format (include IDs created) WITH DETAIL for the user to understand.

Between each loop, fix the issues. Do not stop between loops except for a brief pause. Audit → fix → audit → fix until you hit at least the min stated above, and keep looping beyond the min if there are still issues found until clean.
