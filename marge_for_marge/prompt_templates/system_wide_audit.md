Run a system-wide audit of this workspace/repo.
- Read and understand the architecture and major workflows.

Update/create tracking docs (use the actual folder name where AGENTS.md lives):
- marge_for_marge/assessment.md (snapshot + findings + new MS issues)
- marge_for_marge/tasklist.md (prioritized tasks with DoD + verification)
- marge_for_marge/instructions_log.md (append any new standing instructions I give)

Then immediately start executing the remaining unchecked items in marge_for_marge/tasklist.md (P0 → P1 → P2), keeping docs updated as you go.
Output using the Response Format (include IDs touched).
