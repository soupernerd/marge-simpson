# Prompts

| Prompt | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| [prompt.md](prompt.md) | Questions, features, bugs, confirmations, instructions |
| [audit.md](audit.md) | System review, code analysis (read-only) |
| [suggest.md](suggest.md) | Feature brainstorming (no code) |

**To approve a suggested feature:** Use prompt.md with "Approve feature [N] from recommendations"

**Tip:** Add `loop until clean` to any prompt for iterative mode.
