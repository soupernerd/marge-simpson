## Evolution Protocol

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis

Understand what exists:
- What's working well? (Keep these)
- What's friction? (Improve these)
- What's missing? (Add these)
- What's obsolete? (Remove these)

### Phase 2: User Journey Mapping

Map how users interact with Marge:

```
User arrives → [First prompt used] → [Outcome]
                    ↓
             [Next action] → [Outcome]
                    ↓
               [Continue...until goal met]
```

For each journey:
- Where do they succeed?
- Where do they struggle?
- What's missing?

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis

| Category | Current | Ideal | Gap | Priority |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| Onboarding | [State] | [Goal] | [Gap] | P0/P1/P2 |
| Auditing | [State] | [Goal] | [Gap] | P0/P1/P2 |
| Documentation | [State] | [Goal] | [Gap] | P0/P1/P2 |
| Improvement | [State] | [Goal] | [Gap] | P0/P1/P2 |
| Meta-evolution | [State] | [Goal] | [Gap] | P0/P1/P2 |

### Phase 4: Expert Consultation

Have each expert review findings:

**Product Expert:**
- What user needs are unmet?
- What would delight users?

**Architecture Expert:**
- What structural improvements would help?
- What patterns should we adopt?

**Implementation Expert:**
- What technical debt is holding us back?
- What would make development easier?

**Documentation Expert:**
- What's confusing?
- What's missing?

**Design Expert:**
- What's the UX friction?
- How can we simplify?

**Testing Expert:**
- What's not being validated?
- How can we catch issues earlier?

### Phase 5: Evolution Plan

Create improvement plan:

```markdown
## Evolution Plan — [Focus Area]

### Quick Wins (This Session)
| ID | Improvement | Effort | Impact |
|----|-------------|--------|--------|
| MS-XXXX | [What] | Low | High |

### Medium-Term (Next 3 Sessions)
| ID | Improvement | Effort | Impact |
|----|-------------|--------|--------|
| MS-XXXY | [What] | Medium | High |

### Long-Term (Backlog)
| ID | Improvement | Effort | Impact |
|----|-------------|--------|--------|
| MS-XXXZ | [What] | High | High |
```

### Phase 6: Implement Quick Wins

For each quick win:
1. Create MS-#### ID
2. Implement the improvement
3. Verify with `verify.ps1 fast`
4. Document the change

### Phase 7: Document Evolution

Record what changed and why:
- Update decisions.md with evolution decisions
- Update insights.md with learnings
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Consider VERSION bump
