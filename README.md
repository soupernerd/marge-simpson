# Marge Simpson - sMITten Recursive Context + Experts

## Includes Automated Testing 🛠️

**Marge is a persistent knowledge base that keeps AI assistants informed across sessions.**

It gives AI context about your rules, decisions, and work-in-progress so each session starts informed — not blank. Works with VS Code Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and any AI coding assistant.

## Four Ways to Use Marge

| Method | Best For | How |
|--------|----------|-----|
| 💬 **Chat Prompts** | Interactive work, questions, debugging | Paste prompts into VS Code Copilot, Cursor, etc. |
| 🖥️ **CLI (Local)** | Automation in one project | Run `./cli/marge "task"` from repo |
| 🌐 **CLI (Global)** | Multi-project automation | Install once, run `marge "task"` anywhere |
| 🔧 **Meta Development** | Contributing to Marge | Use the .dev/ tools to improve Marge itself |

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Drop-in Folder (Simplest)

1. **Clone or copy this repo** into your project (name it anything you want)
2. Use a [Chat Prompt](#-chat-prompt-templates) from below

```bash
# Example: copy into your project
cp -r marge-simpson my-project/.marge    # or any name you prefer
```

> **💡 Folder name flexibility:** Prompts use relative paths ("this folder"), so any name works. The CLI uses `.marge` by default when globally installed.

### Option B: CLI (Local)

```bash
# From within this repo
./cli/marge "fix the login bug"
./cli/marge "add dark mode" --model opus
```

### Option C: CLI (Global Install)

```bash
# Install once, use everywhere
./cli/install-global.sh      # macOS/Linux
.\cli\install-global.ps1     # Windows

# Then in any project:
marge init                   # Initialize .marge/ in current project
marge "fix the bug"          # Run task
```

---

# 💬 Chat Prompt Templates

> **Use when:** You're working interactively in VS Code, Cursor, or another IDE with AI chat.

## 🔄 Iterative Loop Mode (optional)

Add a loop phrase to any prompt and Marge will keep iterating until work is complete.

> **🔄 Quick start:** Add `loop until clean` to any prompt template below.
>
> **⚙️ Control iterations:** Add `min 3` or `max 10` to set bounds.
>
> See [prompts/](./prompts/) for ready-to-use templates.

## 🔍 System Audit
*Use first, or periodically to refresh the plan.*

```
Read the AGENTS.md file in this folder and follow it.

Run a system-wide audit of this workspace/repo (read-only).
- Read and understand the architecture and major workflows.
- Identify correctness issues, risky patterns, and high-impact improvements.
- Do not break intended functionality.

Update/create tracking docs:
- tracking/assessment.md (snapshot + findings + new MS issues)
- tracking/tasklist.md (prioritized tasks with DoD + verification)

After finished above, search for and list remaining unchecked items (if any exist) in tracking/tasklist.md (P0 → P1 → P2). Suggest order of operations.

Output using the Response Format (include IDs created).
```

## 📝 Have MARGE Suggest Features
*Let Marge propose new features based on your codebase.*

```
Read and follow the rules in AGENTS.md (in this folder).

MODE: PLANNING ONLY (no code changes, no patches, no execution).

Goal: Propose new features for this project.

Requirements:
- Suggest 3-8 viable feature ideas.
- Rank them highest to lowest by end-user UX / value (UX/value is the primary decision factor).
- Do not prioritize "easy to build" unless it also clearly improves UX/value.
- Do not treat anything as approved - these are proposals only.

For each feature (keep it concise):
- Name (short)
- What it does (1-2 sentences)
- Who it helps / why it matters (1 sentence)
- Biggest risk or dependency (1 bullet)
- How you would validate success (1 bullet; user-facing metric or acceptance criteria)

Output format:
1) Ranked list of features
2) A short "Top pick summary" (2-4 lines) explaining why the #1-#2 options win on UX/value

Update/append/create tracking doc:
- recommended_features.md (with the bullet points created per feature)

Minimize follow-up questions. If info is missing, make reasonable assumptions and state them briefly.
```

## 🔀 Combined Prompts (mix and match)
*Mix questions and issues in one prompt for efficiency.*

```
Read the AGENTS.md file in this folder and follow it.

Questions / Confirmations:
1. (Question/confirmation here)
2. (Question/confirmation here)

Instruction:
- (your instruction here)
- (another instruction here)

New Feature / Issues:
- (New Feature or Issue here)
- (New Feature or Issue here)

After finished above, search for and list remaining unchecked items (if any exist) in tracking/tasklist.md (P0 → P1 → P2). Suggest order of operations.

## 💬 Pro Tips for Chat

### Deep Reasoning ("Ultrathink")
For complex problems, debugging, or architectural decisions:
- "Think extra hard about this"
- "Take your time reasoning through this"
- "Use extended thinking for this problem"

### Fresh Context for Long Sessions
After very long conversations (50+ exchanges), consider:
- Starting a fresh conversation for new major features
- Using session_end workflow to capture knowledge before restarting
- Keeping focused conversations (one major topic per chat)

# Reference

## What It Does

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Reads first** | Opens files before making claims |
| **Tracks work** | Every fix gets an ID (`MS-0001`, `MS-0002`, …) |
| **Verifies** | Runs tests automatically after each fix |
| **Stays focused** | Minimal diffs, root cause fixes |

**Two source-of-truth files:**
- `tracking/tasklist.md` — what's left / doing / done
- `tracking/assessment.md` — root cause notes + verification evidence

## What's Inside

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Rules the assistant follows |
| `tracking/` | Assessment, tasklist, and feature plans |
| `cli/` | CLI tools (marge, marge-init, install-global) |
| `scripts/` | Verify scripts, test suite |
| `workflows/` | Session start/end, planning, audit workflows |
| `experts/` | Domain expert instructions |
| `knowledge/` | Decisions, patterns, preferences |
| `prompts/` | Ready-to-copy templates |
| `.dev/` | Tools for contributing to Marge |

## Test Configuration

Custom test commands in `verify.config.json`:

**Node.js:**
```json
{
  "fast": ["npm test"],
  "full": ["npm ci", "npm test", "npm run build"]
}
```

**Python:**
```json
{
  "fast": ["python -m pytest -q"],
  "full": ["pip install -e .", "python -m pytest", "python -m mypy src/"]
}
```

**Go:**
```json
{
  "fast": ["go test ./..."],
  "full": ["go test -v -race ./...", "go build ./..."]
}
```

No config? Scripts auto-detect Node, Python, Go, Rust, .NET, Java.

## For Contributors

Want to improve Marge itself? See [.dev/README.md](./.dev/README.md) for the meta-development workflow.

Quick version:
1. Run `./.dev/convert-to-meta.sh` (or `.ps1`) to create `.meta_marge/`
2. Use prompts with "Read the AGENTS.md file in the .meta_marge folder"
3. AI makes improvements directly to `marge-simpson/` (guided by `.meta_marge/AGENTS.md`)
4. Test with `./scripts/test-marge.sh` (or `.ps1`)
